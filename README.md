# ðŸŽ® Block Drop.

This is a simple block dropping game built using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, providing a basic implementation of the classic Tetris game and a fun Farcaster miniapp.

## Description

This project demonstrates a fundamental implementation of a block dropping puzzle game. Players control falling blocks, aiming to complete horizontal lines to clear them and score points. The game includes basic features like piece movement, rotation, and line clearing.
The game is a basic implementation of Tetris. It's a fun Farcaster miniapp.

## Technologies Used

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for server-side rendering and building production-ready applications.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling the application.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## How to Play

*   Use the **left and right arrow keys** to move the falling block horizontally.
*   Use the **up arrow key** to rotate the block.
*   Use the **down arrow key** to soft drop the block (move it down faster).
*   Use the **spacebar** to hard drop the block (immediately drop it to the bottom).
*   Complete horizontal lines to clear them and score points.
*   The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the board.
